    <h1>In this project, I created a scenario where:</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>An Ice-cream shop has a selected stock of options in which a customer can choose from (stocks)</li>
        <li>The customer can then make an order (customerOrder).</li>
        <li>Then customer can place an order (order).</li>
        <li>then when the order is received and processed, production begins (production)</li>
        <li>Then when production finishes, the customer receives their Ice-cream Yayy!</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I used a method called callback hell. Ouch!</p>
    <p>Make sure to check out the inspect element, console.</p>
